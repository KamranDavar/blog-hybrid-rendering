This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and is a step of my interview in [Mootanroo](https://mootanroo.com/).
I used these libraries in this project:
Nextjs ,React-Query, Less, Antd & Axios

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
 docker compose up
```
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.

Or:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
